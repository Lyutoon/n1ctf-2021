I turn on -Ofast and unroll the loops manually,so the decomplie result of 'encrypt' is almost 1000 lines,which is difficult to read.
But you must have noticed repeated code snippets,they are results of function inlining & loop unrolling.Just analyze small part of them and recover the loop structure,things will be easier to understand.
After you simpily the encryption routine,you will find the algorithm is CBC-mode,blocksize=64bit.Someone said padding oracle is an unintend sol,but I have not verified that yet.
The process of encrypt and decrypt is similar, typical 3-layer feistel network, very like 3-round DES. You can decrypt arbitrary ciphertext by modifying cookie and visit share.php.
Intended sol is perform a differential attack(a bit different from typical ones,you can't choose plaintext this time),solve the secret key. Use __toString of class User to enumerate /tmp/box/_user,find the flag folder.
And submit a fake serialized class User,modify userinfo path in cookie to your fake user,then you can read arbitrary file in arbitrary folder.
